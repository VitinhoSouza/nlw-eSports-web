# Welcome to **nlw-eSports-web**ðŸ‘‹
In this application, it is possible to **view the available games** and **create an advertisement** for a specific game. 
The aim is to bring together two players who want to play the same game, so that they can play together.

## A preview of the application:

## Techs:
For the construction, a **React + TypeScript** template with **vite** was used. Also used:
- **taliwindcss** for styling;
- **@radix-ui** to import javascript primitive components like modal and checkbox;
- The **phosphor-react** library for using icons;
- **Axios** to consume a backend route.

## Get started:
- Open the terminal inside the project folder and do: *npm install*. When all packages are installed, do *npm run dev* to start in development mode.
